# About the project

This Bash script automates the setup of a new Apache2 VirtualHost, complete with:

* Custom domain configuration (with optional www. subdomain)
* Directory structure creation
* Let's Encrypt SSL certificate setup

### Features

‚úç **User inputs**
* Domain name (e.g. example.com)
* E-Mail address (used for Let's Encrypt registration)
* New system username
* Optional www. subdomain support

üìÇ **Directory structure:**
* Creates following directorys:
```
/var/www/<domain>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ httpdocs   # Web root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs       # Apache logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ files      # Optional file storage
```

üîë **User & permissions:**
* Adds new user (if not existing) with:
* Home directory at /var/www/<domain>
* /usr/sbin/nologin shell (no terminal access)
* Sets ownership and permissions for web and SFTP usage
* User belongs to www-data group

> [!TIP]
> For later FTP access please read the note.

**FTP Access tip**

For FTP access to work, you must change the user's shell from /usr/sbin/nologin to /bin/false. This is required because the script currently sets the user's shell to /usr/sbin/nologin to prevent terminal access. To enable FTP, you can run the following command:

```
sudo chsh -s /bin/false username
```

Replace username with the actual username of the user. This will allow FTP access while still preventing terminal login.

> [!TIP]
> Additionally, make sure your FTP server (e.g. ProFTPD or vsftpd) is configured to allow logins only for users with /bin/false as their shell.
> This ensures that only explicitly designated FTP users are allowed to connect, improving security.

üõ†Ô∏è **Apache configuration:**
* Creates basic HTTP VirtualHost with automatic redirect to HTTPS
* Enables rewrite and ssl modules
* Requests a Let's Encrypt certificate using Certbot
* On success, appends a full HTTPS VirtualHost configuration
* Removes default -le-ssl.conf created by Certbot to avoid conflicts
